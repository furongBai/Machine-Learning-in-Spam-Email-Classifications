This is my machine learning project in the field of spam email. 

In this project, we perform different the linear classification algorithms including: Adaline, Logistic regression, and SVM. For Adaline and Logistic regression, we code concrete steps and write our own algorithms to train the model. For SVM, we used an efficient R. package, “doMC”.

Then we followed by comparing the strength and weakness of each classifier, their performance on detecting spam, and impact of different ways of splitting dataset on model accuracy .
